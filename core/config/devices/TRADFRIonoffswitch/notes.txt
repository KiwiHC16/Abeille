Binding
=======
https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/E1743.html

Binding #
The E1743 can be bound to groups using binding. It can only be bound to 1 group at a time and cannot be bound to a device.

By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
Right before executing the commands make sure to wake up the device by pressing a button on it.

Lot's of issues around bind/unbind.
https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2924

WARNING !!!!
    Below 2.3.075: suppports binding to groups only
    2.3.075 and greater: supports binding to DEVICES ONLY
        IS THAT TRUE ? Using "set remote group" is working with Trafri on/off switch.

About configure reporting
=========================
It looks like it is important to add a delay between dev announce and the configure reporting for battery.
Even if answer is status 00 the reporting is not set if no delay.
