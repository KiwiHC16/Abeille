13.2.2 Channel Interference Resolution
	Upon receipt of an unsolicited Mgmt_NWK_Update_notify, the Network Manager applies different methods to best determine when a channel change is required and how to select the most appropriate channel.

	The Network Manger does the following:

	Upon receipt of the Mgmt_NWK_Update_notify, the Network Manager determines if a channel change is required using the following criteria:
	If any single device has more than ZDNWKMGR_CC_TX_FAILURE (50) percent transmission failures a channel change should be considered.
	The Network Manager compares the failure rate reported on the current channel against the stored failure rate from the last channel change. If the current failure rate is higher than the last failure rate then the channel change is considered.
	If the above data indicate a channel change should be considered, the Network Manager completes the following:
	Select a single channel based on the Mgmt_NWK_Update_notify based on the lowest energy. This is the proposed new channel. If this new channel does not have an energy level below an acceptable threshold ZDNWKMGR_ACCEPTABLE_ENERGY_LEVEL, a channel change should not be done.
	Prior to changing channels, the Network Manager stores the energy scan value as the last energy scan value and the failure rate from the existing channel as the last failure rate.
	The Network Manager broadcasts (to all routers and coordinator) a Mgmt_NWK_Update_req notifying devices of the new channel. It then increments the nwkUpdateId parameter in the NIB and beacon payload, and includes it in the Mgmt_NWK_Update_req. The Network Manager sets a timer based on the value of ZDNWKMGR_UPDATE_REQUEST_TIMER (i.e., apsChannelTimer) upon issue of a Mgmt_NWK_Update_req that changes channels and will not issue another such command until this timer expires.
	Upon issue of a Mgmt_NWK_Update_req with a change of channels, the local Network Manager sets a timer equal to the nwkNetworkBroadcastDeliveryTime and switches channels upon expiration of this timer.
	Upon receipt of a Mgmt_NWK_Update_req with a change of channels from the Network Manager, a device sets a timer equal to the nwkNetworkBroadcastDeliveryTime and switches channels upon expiration of this timer. Each node stores the received nwkUpdateId in the NIB and beacon payload, and also resets the total transmit count and the transmit failure counters.

	For devices with RxOnWhenIdle equals FALSE, any network channel change will not be received. On these devices or routers that have lost the network, an active scan is conducted on the channelList in the NIB (i.e., apsChannelMask) using the extended PAN ID (EPID) to find the network. If the extended PAN ID is found on different channels, the device selects the channel with the higher value in the nwkUpdateId parameter. If the extended PAN ID is not found using the apsChannelMask list, a scan is completed using all channels.
