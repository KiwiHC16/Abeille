Complex case as many capabilities.
- BindToGroup: Ex Tradfri On/off switch. Need to use "set remote group" (what's inside ?) to set same group as target.
- BindToDevice: Tradfri On/off switch was supposed to run in this mode with recent FW but point above is working.
- How to deal with cluster 1000 (commissioning) ?
