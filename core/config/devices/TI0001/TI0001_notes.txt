Needs to be paired on Channel 26! Then you can eventually switch the channel to 11 and Livolo devices will be switching automatically
Uses transition field to define switch number

May need a specific Ext PAN ID
    [ 0x21, 0x75, 0x8d, 0x19, 0x00, 0x4b, 0x12, 0x00 ] - Original livolo gateway extPanId
    or extPanId must be 0x00124b00198d7521

    - We need to use the specific channelId and extPanId.
    - We need to send ZCL OnOff: Toggle after the device is connected to the coordinator (only once).
    - Poll the device ZCL OnOff: Read to get the current state of buttons.
