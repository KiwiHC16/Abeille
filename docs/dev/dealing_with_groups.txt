*** Dealing with Zigbee groups
*** (C) Tcharp38

Reminder: Zigbee groups allow to "group" several target devices with a single "group address" and send group commands.
This for example allow to switch On/Off several light bulb with a single group On/Off command sent to group instead of device.

Target control
==============

Zigbee groups on server side (target devices) are quite easy to deal with since there are
all commands available thru cluster 0004 to add/get/remove any group.
Moreover these devices are ALWAYS ON meaning that we can send them a cmd at any time.

Abeille is collecting & storing current group status in eqLogic DB thru "configuration/zigbee/groups" oject.
Object is sorted per end point since each EP can be affected to a different set of groups.

    "ab::zigbee": {
        "groups" : {'01': '1001', '02': '2002'}
    }

Remote
======

On the other side (control device), this is much more complex.
The remote control
- has to support "sent to group"
- is a device not always listening network

If remote control is Abeille (virtual remote or any command from Abeille itself),
groups are selected thru "variables" (currently in 'main' tab).
These "variables" must be aligned to group to control.
