*** Automatic update of Abeille version using GIT hooks
***

What's hook ?
=============
Those are small LOCAL scripts called (if exist) on specific conditions.
For example the 'pre-push' script will be called just before completing
the 'git push' command.

It is therefore easy to
- collect useful infos (branch, date, last commit)
- generate a new version string into 'plugin_info/AbeilleVersion.inc'
- add & commit this version update

Problems
========
Hooks are LOCAL scripts which are NOT versionned.
Those must therefore be manually installed once.
The script ".hooks/install_hooks.sh" is the one to use for that purpose.
It must be called once only. Hooks can later be updated automatically on each "git pull".

Installation ... ONCE only
==========================
Execute '.hooks/install_hooks.sh' script.
That's all. On next pulls, scripts changes will be automatically updated from ".hooks" to ".git/hooks"
