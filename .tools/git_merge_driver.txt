How to automatically merge some files
=====================================
# .gitattributes update

# Automatically solve conflicts for the following files.
# Note: They need to be updated anyway after a merge.
# Note: Using keepMine for MD5 & keepTheir for version
#       in order to have different branch name
#       and prevent wrong integrity check.
plugin_info/Abeille.md5 merge=keepMine
plugin_info/Abeille.version merge=keepTheir
plugin_info/info.json merge=keepMine


# .git/config update
# Add the following lines

[merge "keepMine"]
   name = always keep mine during merge
   driver = exit 0
[merge "keepTheir"]
   name = always keep their during merge
   driver = cp -f %B %A
